Changes to part 3:

Much was changed with this as a lot of the existing code from part 2 had to be altered to allow for buttons and event handlers.
Most of the code was stripped only the base logic remains and even that has been heavily altered.
This was to accommdate for the new GUI implementation using WPF. 
The code was further optimised with all the feedback given.


How to run:

In order to run this code you will have to open it up in Visual Studio or any IDE of your choice preferably visual studio though. 
Look at your solution explorer and click on the MainWindow.xaml.cs file to bring it up and lick the run button.
Now in the app type your new recipe name and click the add recipe button, you will now see your recipe name displayed in the last below.
Go to the ingredients section and add your ingredient details.
Go to the steps section and add your steps for the recipe, you will see a tickbox appear once you click the add recipe step button.
Go to the filter section in order to filter for your recipe you need to fill in the relevant details.
This will allow you to fileter through your recipe list by ingredient, food group and maximum calories.
